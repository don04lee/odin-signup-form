Sign-Up Form

This is my solution to the Odin Project's SignUp form. This uses newly-founded knowledge of the form attribute, as well as using new units such as vw and vh and percentages to make the look of the site to be satisfactory even at different aspect ratios. HTML and CSS was mostly used, with a sprinkle of JS.

The hardest part of this project was identifying how the format would look while trying to position so that the perspective would look satisfactory. There was a lot of new things I had learned that I tried to apply on this sign-up form, but they all could be made better. I also thought that having more descriptive css would be better, but I realized it became more of a hindrance when I had to add new divs to match the format I wanted, and every style that I had made previously had to be edited.

A change I would want to learn how to make in the future is how to make this sign-up form look satisfactory even on mobile or when the window is a lot more vertically larger than horizontally.
